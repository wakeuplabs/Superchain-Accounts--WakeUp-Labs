# Superchain Accounts - WakeUp Labs
## This is the proposal we submitted, which led to our selection and subsequent winning of the respective mission.


### _Describe in discrete steps your plan for accomplishing your project:_

- The project kicks off with a Design Phase, during which the WakeUp team will complete technical specs and the design for Superchain Accounts. This phase also includes developing a prototype to showcase functionality and user interaction, which will be tested by collaborators within the Optimism ecosystem.

      - The Figma Design, as well as the Prototype, will be shared with the community through the Open Source Repo assigned to the project.
  
      - Should the technical research be compiled into a document, it will also be shared there.
 

- The development phase continues with a focus on constructing the essential smart contracts and user interface components. This stage is characterized by detailed documentation and thorough testing to ensure both security and usability. WakeUp is dedicated to maintaining the highest standards of quality throughout this process.

      It makes sense to clarify that at this stage, everything developed will be displayed and explained in its corresponding Open Source repository.

- SuperChain Points may be issued as non-transferable ERC-20 tokens, enhancing the amount of on-chain transactions and enabling their tracking on the blockchain.

      Using Soulbound Tokens for SuperChain Points can help reduce attempts at Sybil attacks.

- Claimable Badges will be non-transferable ERC-721, enhancing the amount of on-chain transactions and enabling their tracking on the blockchain.

      Using Soulbound Tokens for Badges might help reduce Sybil attacks.

- Raffle tickets will be issued as ERC-1155 tokens. For these raffles, a new smart contract will be automatically deployed for each raffle after a specified period, resulting in an increased number of on-chain contracts, transactions, and a viable verification method.

- SuperChain Accounts might be dynamic ERC-721 NFTs, symbolizing the user's achievements and level.

      To mitigate the damage that can be caused by Sybil attacks, some of the claimable badges will be linked to identity verification, similar to how projects like Talent Protocol or GitCoin Passport do it, while still being completely optional.

- After completing development, we’ll test, do corresponding fixes and launch the final version. We will deploy the Superchain Accounts on Optimism Mainnet with accomplishments fetched from OP Mainnet and Base.

- To promote awareness and encourage adoption, community engagement strategies will also be deployed. With that in mind, we aim to enhance participation, utilizing weekly raffles, airdrops, and other incentives to boost engagement.

      - WakeUp commits to spending at least 2500 $OP over the course of 5 weeks for this initiative.

      - WakeUp Labs works very closely with communities in Latin America, making this region more than reachable for conducting the first tests with real users. This will provide genuine feedback for further iteration of the product. Subsequently, with the help of BadgeHolders and the OP community, the reach can extend to the rest of the users within the ecosystem.

- We will monitor user engagement and make necessary adjustments to our strategy. The aim is to elevate user activity and retention, showcasing the benefits of Smart Accounts.

- The project culminates with the compilation of a comprehensive report, detailing the project's impact and integrating feedback from stakeholders and the community. This document will guide future iterations, ensuring ongoing improvement and alignment with the Superchain Ecosystem's needs. 

      At this stage, the documentation and explanations shared in the open source repository will also be organized and improved.

- WakeUp Labs is committed to providing support to this initiative for 2+ years after the conclusion of grant rewards.We will cover for 2+ years the following aspects: 

      - Technical Support & Maintenance
      - Hosting
      - Bugs fixes
      - Users support
      - Educational and marketing initiatives
      - Stats & Users insights in the dedicated topic in the Optimism forum.

**Additional Info:**

- This project is a community-driven initiative proposed by the community, and both the experience and its results must be shared with it. That's why the entire project's source code will be open-source, forever.

- Deliverable documents will be added to the repository to facilitate tracking.

### _Please provide any additional information that will facilitate accountability:_
***smart contract addresses relevant to the proposal, relevant organizational wallet addresses, etc.***

* We will track the progress of the mission through a dedicated topic in the Optimism forum. There, we will provide monthly updates on the development phase, user engagement statistics, feedback highlights, and technical recommendations for future steps.
    * This topic will also be linked to the existing general communication thread of WakeUp Labs. https://gov.optimism.io/t/wakeup-labs-general-comms-thread-our-journey-on-optimism/7822``
    * Once the Milestones are completed, we plan to keep these reports active for at least 2 years, with a frequency of 1 report per quarter.

* Given that the project is open source, it will be possible to track activity directly with the repository.

* At the mission's conclusion, a recap article will feature:
    * Total SuperChain Accounts created.
    * Number of Badges claimed.
    * Amount of SuperChain Points earned by users. 
    * Transaction counts.
    * Insights on user retention and transaction volume.
    * Feedback from Badgeholders, collected through interviews.
    * Lessons learned from Season 5.
    * Suggestions for future updates.

With these accountability measures, WakeUp guarantees that the development and implementation will meet the highest standards for quality, transparency, community involvement, and strategic foresight.

## Milestones
